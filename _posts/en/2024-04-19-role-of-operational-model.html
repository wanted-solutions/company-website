<p>In the fast-paced world of software development, it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of building new features and shipping products. However, without a strong operational model in place, even the most innovative applications can quickly crumble under the weight of real-world demands.</p>

<h2>Key Techniques and Disciplines</h2>

<p>To establish a resilient operational model, several key techniques and disciplines must be introduced into the software development lifecycle:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Monitoring and Alerting:</strong> Implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems to proactively identify and address issues before they escalate.</li>
    <li><strong>Incident Management:</strong> Establishing clear processes for handling incidents, including roles, responsibilities, and communication channels.</li>
    <li><strong>Capacity Planning:</strong> Regularly assessing and forecasting resource requirements to ensure the application can handle expected and unexpected loads.</li>
    <li><strong>Disaster Recovery:</strong> Developing and testing disaster recovery plans to minimize downtime and data loss in the event of a catastrophic failure.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> Implementing robust security measures and adhering to relevant compliance standards to protect sensitive data and maintain trust.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Role of SREs</h2>

<p>Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) play a crucial role in modern software operations. Unlike traditional IT roles that focus on maintaining infrastructure, SREs bridge the gap between development and operations, bringing a software engineering mindset to operational challenges.</p>

<p>SREs work closely with development teams to design scalable and fault-tolerant systems, automate operational tasks, and continuously improve the reliability and performance of applications. By leveraging their expertise in both software development and operations, SREs help organizations strike a balance between innovation and stability.</p>

<h2>The Pitfalls of Neglecting Operations</h2>

<p>In a previous <a href="https://wanted.solutions/software-development/role-of-planning-in-software-development/" title="Link to article: role-of-planning-in-software-development">article</a>, we discussed how removing planning from the software development lifecycle can lead to chaos and inefficiency. The same principle applies to operations. All too often, organizations rush to deploy applications without defining clear operational responsibilities or establishing proper support structures.</p>

<p>This lack of operational planning can have severe consequences. Without designated personnel to monitor and maintain the application, issues can go unnoticed until they escalate into full-blown outages. Inadequate backup and disaster recovery procedures can result in data loss and prolonged downtime. Neglecting security and compliance requirements can expose the organization to legal and reputational risks.</p>

<h2>Embracing Operational Excellence</h2>

<p>To avoid these pitfalls and ensure the long-term success of software applications, organizations must prioritize operational excellence. This involves:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Defining clear Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to set expectations and measure performance.</li>
    <li>Conducting regular risk assessments and implementing mitigation strategies to minimize potential disruptions.</li>
    <li>Investing in automation and self-healing systems to reduce manual intervention and improve reliability.</li>
    <li>Fostering a culture of continuous improvement, where lessons learned from incidents are used to drive operational enhancements.</li>
</ul>

<p>By embracing these practices and empowering SREs to lead the charge, organizations can build software applications that not only deliver value to users but also stand the test of time in production environments.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the end, a strong operational model is not a luxury but a necessity in modern software development. By investing in the right techniques, disciplines, and roles, organizations can ensure that their applications are not only built to last but also operated with excellence. So, let's not forget the importance of operations amidst the excitement of innovation – because, as they say, "the show must go on!"</p>
